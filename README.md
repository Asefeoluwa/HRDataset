# HR Dataset
In this project I use SQL to carry out Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on this dataset. Having no context on which company this is, what products they offer, or the industry they belongto, through EDA I was able to spot some interesting facts about this company that allows me to profie it a little.

For Example:

-- It's a Female powered company.

-- The company hires a lot of Product Techinicians. So might be a technology company OR Factory.

-- They have only 2 C-suite level staff. The CEO & The CIO both female

-- Racially 66% of historical employees are white
